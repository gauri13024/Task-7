**ðŸ“Œ Task 7: Fetch and Display Data from a Public API**
In this task, I created a responsive webpage that fetches and displays user information from a public API using the JavaScript Fetch API. The data is retrieved from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users and includes details like the user's name, email, and address. I used HTML to structure the content, CSS to style the user cards, and JavaScript to handle the API request, parse the JSON response, and dynamically display each user's information in a neatly styled card format. I also implemented error handling using a try...catch block to display a user-friendly message if the network is unavailable. Additionally, I added a "Reload Users" button to allow users to refetch and refresh the displayed data anytime. This project demonstrates asynchronous data fetching, DOM manipulation, and basic error management in a user-friendly web application
